<a name="VS-Code"></a>**VS Code** provides two different scopes for settings:

- **User Settings** - Settings that apply globally to any instance of VS Code you open.
- **Workspace Settings** - Settings stored inside your workspace and only apply when the workspace is opened.

Workspace settings override user settings. Workspace settings are specific to a project and can be shared across developers on a project.

> **Note**: A VS Code "workspace" is usually just your project root folder. Workspace settings as well as [debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) and [task](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks) configurations are stored at the root in a `.vscode` folder. You can also have more than one root folder in a VS Code workspace through a feature called [Multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces)
